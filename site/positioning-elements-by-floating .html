	<P id="p1">n this lecture we're going to talk about positioning elements by floating them. Now knowing how to properly float elements is an essential skill to have, and this is partially because most of the UIs today, web UIs today that are made, are made by floating the elements. In fact, by the end of this lecture, we're going to create a two column flexible design where the columns will be flexible as we expand and contract the browser. So let's jump into the code editor and see how this works</p>
